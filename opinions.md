# Why automation?
Humans are good at making decisions and awful at reliable implementation. Machines are pitiful at making decisions and very good at reliable implementation. It makes sense to let each side do the job that they are good at.
The main problem in managing systems is a loss of self-discipline. Displine does not imply that order have to be barked from a central command. It only requires that every part of the system knows its job and carries is out seamlessly and flawlessly.
Skilled workers tend to think that it is enough to be smart. In fact this is wrong: smart peo- ple tend to be problem solvers and will happily solve the same problem many times, wasting time and effort. Moreover, human intervention is often based on panic and lack of understanding so every time someone logs onto a system by hand, they jeopardize everyone's understanding of the system. Only the self-discipline of stable procedures leads to predictability.

**  Ad hoc changes are bad because: **
- • Others have no idea what happened.
- • There is no record of changes or intentions. 
- • A scar is left from the change.

People often rile against automation saying that is dehumanizes their work. In fact the opposite is true: forcing humans to do the work of machines, in repetetive and reliable ways is what dehumanizes people. The only way to make progress with a bad habit is to recognize it and be willing to abandon the habit.
